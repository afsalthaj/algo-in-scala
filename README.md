# algo-in-scala

Solutions to algorithmic questions in Cracking-The-Coding-Interview using Scala. 

The intention of this project is to make use of recursion (only tail calls) as much as possible, 
and experiment how far can scala can be your choice to perform these algorithms,
while still focussing on inplace mutations to minimise both space and time complexity.
